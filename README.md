# Fingero

#### Web application for tracking finger motion and drawing with it live. 
#### It detects a tip of Your finger using [gocv](https://gocv.io/) package (go + openCV 4.0). 
#### From the front-end side it benefits from [React's](https://reactjs.org/) ability to refresh components live, which suits our problem perfectly.
#### Communication between front-end and back-end has been achieved using [gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket).
- #### Front-end to back-end communication:
  - ##### sending images live from a web-camera
- #### Back-end to fron-end communication:
  - ##### sending json files with (X, Y) coordinates of the tracked finger
